## Daily Goods

This application was created to be an exposure project. I wanted to create something in Electron, and React. This gave me a convienent excuse to do so.

The purpose of this project is to have a desktop application that my wife can use to send items to the companion app on my phone. That way I have a nice categorized list of things I might need to pickup on the way home from work.

# TODO

1. ~~Setup Firebase for storing items from client to server.~~
2. ~~Client should get items from Firebase.~~
3. ~~Possibly socketIO to get items in realtime.~~
4. Users and profiles with unique codes for lists to populate with items.
5. ~~Login/signup functionality.~~
6. Forgot password functionality.
7. Proper display for login/signup/logout
8. Make it look good ⭐️
